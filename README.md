# <Mini Project 04 - Code Quiz>

## Description

This is the mini project 04 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. For this project I was not given any starter code, instead I created all code from scratch. This project creates a code quiz with a timer and several event listeners. The html, JavaScript, and CSS files work together to ensure seamless timers across all questions, time out functions, and timer penalties for incorrect answers. At the end of the quiz the user is invited to enter their initials to a high score board that utilizes local storage to maintain the scores and user initials.
